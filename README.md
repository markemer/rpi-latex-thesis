RPI Thesis LaTeX
================

I have made a number of changes to the Thesis class;
**These changes are in no way endorsed by any official at RPI/OGE.**

I have merged Elsa's (@gonsie) changes back into this repo. [https://github.com/gonsie/rpi-latex-thesis]

## Summary of Changes

- Now using Unix line-endings, with no blank spaces at the end of lines
- Commented out the bibentry def.
  Un-comment [line 314](https://github.com/gonsie/rpi-latex-thesis/blob/master/thesis.cls#L314) "for use in making an unnumbered bibliography with hanging indents."
