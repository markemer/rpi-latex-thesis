\specialhead{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}
The acknowledgment text goes here. Unlike chapter headings,
this heading is not numbered.

\specialhead{ABSTRACT}
Write your abstract here. Again, the heading does receive a number.

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
The text of the first chapter goes here. To cite a reference for the
bibliography, use a command such as:\cite{thisbook}
\section{A Section Heading}
This is a sentence to take up space and look like text.
\subsection{A Subsection Heading}

\chapter{THE NEXT CHAPTER}
And so on, for more chapters.
Another citation for the bibliography:\cite{anotherbook}

% The following produces a numbered bibliography where the numbers
% correspond to the \cite commands in the text.
\specialhead{LITERATURE CITED}
\begin{singlespace}
\begin{thebibliography}{99}
\bibitem{thisbook} This is the first item in the Bibliography.
Let's make it very long so it takes more than one line.
Let's make it very long so it takes more than one line.

This is how equations are numbered in an appendix:
\begin{equation}
x^2 + y^2 = z^2
\end{equation}

\chapter{THIS IS ANOTHER APPENDIX}
This is a sentence to take up space and look like text.
