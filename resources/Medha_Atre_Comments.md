> Also a quick note: the grad office is very nit-picky about bibliography
appearance and on top of that they have *no idea* what LaTeX is, so that
can really make you lose your mind while trying to explain a particular
bibliography appearance (they ask style-guide proofs for everything).

> Somethings I am being punished for --

> 1. Different URL font (texttt) in bibliography
2.  Not having volume or issue number for "conferences" (because they
don't know that conferences proceedings don't have volume or issue number).
3. Page number format -- because they don't know what BibTeX is and are
asking me to provide proofs that this is the correct format (although I
tried to explain that I have not manipulated anything out of my own mind
and everything is done automatically by BibTeX and LaTeX)!
4. Having "c" of conference non-capitalized when the word "conference"
does not appear as a proper name of the conference..

> The list goes on.. but this is the glimpse.. so beware and plan your
dissertation submission accordingly!

> I wish the CS grad students who went through this trauma earlier had
alerted everyone else, but better late than never!

> The best way (as I have learnt the hard way) to submit your dissertation
is -- print it on the normal pages, take it to OGE, let it remain with
them for couple of weeks or more (that's how long they take to approve),
and after they are done with all their demands, you can print on the
acid-free cotton paper and submit finally.

> The worst thing you want to do is submit the dissertation, move out of
the town, and then "defend" your dissertation *printed copy* once again
to the OGE (after you are done defending the content to your committee
during your real defense)! :(

> Just an alert!
